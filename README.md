# Vector Calculator

This project is a vector calculator implemented in C. It provides functionalities to perform various vector operations such as addition, subtraction, dot product, and cross product.

## Features

- Add two vectors
- Subtract one vector from another
- Calculate the dot product of two vectors
- Calculate the cross product of two vectors

## Project Structure

```
vector-calculator
├── src
│   ├── main.c          # Entry point of the application
│   ├── vector.c        # Implementation of vector operations
│   └── vector.h        # Header file for vector operations
├── Makefile            # Build instructions
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
make
```

This will compile the source files and create the executable.

## Running the Project

After building the project, you can run the vector calculator using the following command:

```
./vector-calculator
```

## Usage

Once the program is running, you will be prompted to enter the vectors and the operation you wish to perform. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete your calculations.

## Examples

1. **Addition**: Enter two vectors to get their sum.
2. **Subtraction**: Enter two vectors to get the result of the first vector minus the second.
3. **Dot Product**: Enter two vectors to calculate their dot product.
4. **Cross Product**: Enter two vectors to calculate their cross product.
