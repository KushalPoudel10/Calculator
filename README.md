# Vector Calculator

This project is a vector calculator implemented in C. It provides functionalities to perform various vector operations such as addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, and more.

## Features

- Add two vectors
- Subtract one vector from another
- Calculate the dot product of two vectors
- Calculate the cross product of two vectors
- Calculate the magnitude of a vector
- Normalize a vector
- Calculate the angle between two vectors
- Project one vector onto another
- Perform all calculations at once
- Scalar multiplication of a vector
- Divide a vector by a scalar

## Project Structure

```

## Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
make
```

This will compile the source files and create the executable.

## Running the Project

After building the project, you can run the vector calculator using the following command:

```
./vector-calculator
```

## Usage

Once the program is running, you will be prompted to enter the vectors and the operation you wish to perform. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete your calculations.

## Examples

1. **Addition**: Enter two vectors to get their sum.
2. **Subtraction**: Enter two vectors to get the result of the first vector minus the second.
3. **Dot Product**: Enter two vectors to calculate their dot product.
4. **Cross Product**: Enter two vectors to calculate their cross product.
5. **Magnitude**: Enter a vector to calculate its magnitude.
6. **Normalization**: Enter a vector to normalize it.
7. **Angle Between Vectors**: Enter two vectors to calculate the angle between them.
8. **Projection**: Enter two vectors to project the first vector onto the second.
9. **Perform All Calculations**: Enter two vectors to perform all the above calculations.
10. **Scalar Multiplication**: Enter a vector and a scalar to multiply the vector by the scalar.
11. **Vector Division by Scalar**: Enter a vector and a scalar to divide the vector by the scalar.
